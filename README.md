# Monte Carlo simulation of protein unfolding
This was a university class assignment to simulate protein unfolding using the Monte Carlo simulation and the Metropolis criterion. 

The protein is modelled in a 2D grid using circles for residues and sticks for peptide bonds. The Monte Carlo simulation scheme and the Metropolis criterion are defined as follows:

This repo also contains an analysis conducted by us on the simulated data and resulting conclusions.
